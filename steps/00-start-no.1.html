        <p>DevOps was originally about WebOps at Internet companies working in the Cloud, and a handful of Lean Startups in
            Silicon Valley. It started at these companies because they had to move quickly, so they found new, simple, and
            collaborative ways of working that allowed them to innovate much faster and to scale much more effectively than
            organizations had done before. </p>

    <p>Why not?
        <ul>
            <li>Because it is complicated</li>
            <li>Because of law regulations</li>
            <li>When Facebook is down, people tweet about it, but when bank is down people take money somwhere else.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>History from my life about "what can happened when bank is down". Imagine that you invite parents of your bride-to-be
        to the official dinner in very expensive restaurant. To show off, how good you are. After the diner you would like
        to pay, but bank is down. How do you feel?. This history is true and was published on social media. It happened not
        from our fault, but it happened. We lost our client. Such situation would happened on facebook or ebay, because banking
        is much more serious stuff</p>
    <p>But what am I doing here if the answer is nooooooo? next slide</p>
