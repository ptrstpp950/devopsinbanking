<h2>IT vs Sport</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Tennis, swimming, runners, ... - we aren't alone</li>
    <li>Football - no may goals in the match</li>
    <li>Handball - who is "goalkeeper" in IT?</li>
</ol>

        I was thinking about sport simmilar to deploing IT stuff. 
        I had to cross-out swimming, tennis, atletics, adn more - because playes are alone. 
        
        Andre Aggasi one day said that tennis players are the loneliness guys in the world. In IT we aren't alone. 
        Moreoverwe have friends and foes.

        So I needed a team sport. 
        Football is popular but usually there are no mamy goals in a match. In agile "goals" should be frequent.<br/> 
        When I think about handball, one of most imporant player is "goalkeeper". In IT there shouldn't anybody like him.<br/>
        Baseball looks good, but be serious we don't try to hit our software as far as possible.<br/>

        What had left?
