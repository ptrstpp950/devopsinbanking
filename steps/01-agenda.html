<h2>IT vs Sport</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Tennis, swimming, runners, ... - we aren't alone</li>
    <li>Football - no many goals in the match</li>
    <li>Handball - who is "goalkeeper" in IT?</li>
</ol>

        I was thinking about sports similar to deploying IT stuff. 
        I had to cross-out swimming, tennis, athletics, and more - because players are alone. 
        
        Andre Aggasi one day said that tennis players are the loneliness guys in the world. In IT, we aren't alone. 
        Moreover  have friends and foes.

        So I needed a team sport. 
        Football is popular but usually, there are no many goals in a match. In agile "goals" should be frequent.<br/> 
        When I think about handball, one of most important player is "goalkeeper". In IT, there shouldn't anybody like him.<br/>
        Baseball looks good but seriously we don't try to hit our software as far as possible.<br/>

        What had left?
