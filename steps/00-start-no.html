        DevOps was originally about WebOps at Internet companies working in the Cloud, 
        and a handful of Lean Startups in Silicon Valley. 
        It started at these companies because they had to move quickly, 
        so they found new, simple, and collaborative ways of working 
        that allowed them to innovate much faster and to scale much more effectively than organizations had done before.
        
        But as the velocity of change in business continues to increase. 
        Enterprise —sometimes referred to as “horses,” in contrast to the unicorns referenced above 
        must also move to deliver content and features to customers just as quickly. 
        
        These large organizations have started to adopt (and, along the way, adapt) DevOps ideas, practices, and tools.
