    <b>DEPLOY - INTRO</b>
    It is difficult to put ball in the basket. Also it is difficult to install software on production.<br/>
    Especially if it is done rare.<br/>
    
    As I remember the old days in mBank we deployed stuff few times a day into test enviroment.<br/> 
    But big release was like one in 5 months. The fun fact: we aloved hotfixes and in 5 monthes period we had more than 60.<br/> 
    It means that we installed software evey second working day :)
