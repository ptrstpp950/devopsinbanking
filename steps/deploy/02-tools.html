    <p>Why custom stuff?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You already have it :)</li>
        <li>You have something strange/differenent, so you will have to code it anyway</li>
        <li>You like to create your own:)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Why do I put Chef/Puppet/Ansible in one line and Octopus in other></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Octopus and Chef/Puppet/Ansible are different. In fact, I don't think there's any reason to choose.</p>
        <p>Puppet and Chef are configuration management tools. They work by describing the state that a system should be in,
            and they take steps to ensure systems are in that state. </p>
        <p>For example, imagine you were managing 30 web servers. Rather than using remote desktop to configure them all, installing
            Windows components, enabling features, and so on, you could use Puppet or Chef to specify: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All web servers should have IIS configured with the Windows Authentication module enabled</li>
            <li>MSMQ should be installed and running</li>
            <li>A folder at <code>C:\Logs</code> should exist and be writable by a given user account</li>
        </ul>
