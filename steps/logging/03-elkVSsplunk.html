<h2>Splunk VS ELK</h2>
<div>Most popular logs aggregators in onsite model are:</div>
<ul>
    <li>ELK - Elastic Search with Kibana</li>
    <li>Splunk</li>
    <li>Systems based on HDFS and Kafka </li>
</ul>


<div class="notes">
    Splunk - It's a very powerful, mainly on-premise solution. More or less very expensive :) <br/>
    If you only want a "supergrep" command it is probably a wrong choice 
    <br/><br/>
    ELK - License fees not incurred, but you'll end up spending $ on building various features
    because ELK doesn't have them. It is a "supergrep". Rest you will have to do by your own
    <br/><br/>
    About the rest - I don't know. I never used them.
