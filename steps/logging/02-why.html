<ol>
    <li>Easy to browse log - there are in one place</li>
    <li>Easy to correlate - there are in one place</li>
    <li>Easy to browse history - it is in one place</li>
    <li>Make alerts - if platform supports</li>
</ol>

        <li>Logs are a critical part of any system, they give you insight into what a system is doing as well what happened</li>
        <li>Virtually every process running on a system generates logs in some form or another. </li>
        <li>Usually, these logs are written to files on local disks. </li>
        <li>When your system grows to multiple hosts, managing the logs and accessing them can get complicated.</li>
        <li>Searching for a particular error across hundreds of log files on hundreds of servers is difficult without good tools.</li>
        <li>A common approach to this problem is to setup a centralized logging solution so that multiple logs can be aggregated in a central location.</li>
    </ul>
