<div class="notes">
    <p>In every professional sport we can browse stats. To view history of a player, team or even a coach.</p>
    <p> To ask questions like:
        <ul>
            <li>Do he or she performing well?</li>
            <li>Why the team A is better?</li>
            <li>Which players has problems? And much more.</li>
        </ul>
        In IT system situation is similar. But instead of statistics we have logs.</p>
