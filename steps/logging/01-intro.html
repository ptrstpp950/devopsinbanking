<div class="notes">
    <p>In every professional sport, we can browse stats. To view the history of a player, team or even a coach.</p>
    <p> To ask questions like:
        <ul>
            <li>Do he or she perform well?</li>
            <li>Why is the team A better?</li>
            <li>Which players have problems? And much more.</li>
            <li>Even maybe why Athletico win with Barcelona in Champions League?</li>
        </ul>
        In IT system situation is similar. But instead of statistics we have logs.</p>
