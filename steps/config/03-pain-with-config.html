<h2>Config hell</h2>
<p>How to mange configuration for 3+ different enviroments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Manualy create config</li>
    <li>Use App.Relase.config (with SlowCheetah)</li>
    <li>Put in source control MyApp.ENV.config</li>
    <li>No config differences - changes in hosts file</li>
</ul>

    <p>The first simptom of complicated deployment is <b>Config hell</b></p>
    <p>
        Let's stop with the number "3". Why it is 3+? Because simplest architecture assumes 3: dev, test, prem.<br/>
        Simple next step is "prem-copy". Then we add "performance env", "uat env", "feature branch env". 
        And we ends with 10, 20 or even 100
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Manual steps are bad. Always bad. After 100 reapeats you will kill someone:D
        </li>
        <li>
            Next try - config transormation are easy way to manage simple config definitions.
            For different files than Web.Config we can use SlowCheetah plugin.
        </li>
        <li>
            Files like MyApp.Enviroment.config in git are so difficult to manage. 
            When we do any change we have to remember about all files. It is to easy to make an error.
            But this is a very popular solution.
            One very big disadvantage for above solutions: every developer can access and change all config files.
        </li>
        <li>
            That is a really cool approach. Imagine that you hardcode all hosts names like "myAppApplicationServer"
            and uses certificate for connection called "mySuperSecretCertificate".
            On diffrent enviroments you just switch contents of DNS or cerificate store or anything you need.
            <br/>
            The only problems is with external secret keys like facebook api secret key. But you can solve it :) 
            I want to try this approach one day. It sound really cool.
