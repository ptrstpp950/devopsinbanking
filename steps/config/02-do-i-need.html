<h2>Do I need a deployment tool?</h2>
<p><b>"It depends"</b> is the best answer</p>
<p>Example simple tools:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Azure Web Sites - automatically deploy from git</li>
    <li>XCOPY - ugly but enough in simple cases</li>
    <li>Setup project - great for Windows app</li>
    <li>"Store" app - separate process</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
    Above examples can work great for simple apps or even big monolith. 
    If everything is in one solution there is a probably big chance that you don't need special tools
    
    Moreover if you don't feel time waste or pain in the ass, you shouldn't change your process.
    You ask yoursel why? because you won't feel any difference :)
