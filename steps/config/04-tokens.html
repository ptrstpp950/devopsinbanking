    My favorite approach. In my company we are using it almost everywhere. 
    Instead of having multiple config files, we have one. But with "gaps" called tokes.
    They have specific notation. In our case it is $ and mustache brackets.
    <br/>
    This approach is used in mamy popular DevOps tools. 
    For example Octopus Deploy and Chef. Of course notaion is different.
    <br/> 
    Every instalation just fill tokens and configs are almost same on every enviroment.
    <br/>---<br/>
    The funny error from migration into .NET 4.6.1 is that we had a token with SQL server intance name.
    On every enviroments we had a named server like "SqlServerHost", but on production we had IP adress.
    Fortunatley Jacek the administaror, checked fast what is wrong on StackOverflow and fix the token.
    That is a great example of DevOps culture and responsible on both sides.
