        <p>The client-side discovery pattern has a variety of benefits and drawbacks. This pattern is relatively straightforward
            and, except for the service registry, there are no other moving parts. Also, since the client knows about the
            available services instances, it can make intelligent, application-specific load-balancing decisions such as
            using hashing consistently. One significant drawback of this pattern is that it couples the client with the service
            registry. You must implement client-side service discovery logic for each programming language and framework
            used by your service clients.</p>
