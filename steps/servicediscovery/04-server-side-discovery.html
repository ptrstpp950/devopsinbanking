    <blockquote>
        <p>The server-side discovery pattern has several benefits and drawbacks. One great benefit of this pattern is that details
            of discovery are abstracted away from the client. Clients simply make requests to the load balancer. This eliminates
            the need to implement discovery logic for each programming language and framework used by your service clients.
            Also, as mentioned above, some deployment environments provide this functionality for free. This pattern also
            has some drawbacks, however. Unless the load balancer is provided by the deployment environment, it is yet another
            highly available system component that you need to set up and manage.</p>
