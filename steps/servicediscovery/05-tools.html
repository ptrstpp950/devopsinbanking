        <li>Files - good as first step, but nothing more. Tokens+automatic deployment helps but it doesn't solve everything.
            It is a quite popular solution. For example included in RabbitMq, Cassandra as service discovery start. 
            Also my company use something like in retail banking.

            Variation of files. But provides single point of failure. Used in other part of my company. In the corporate banking.

        <li>, Netflix Eureka is a good example of a service registry. It provides a REST API for registering and querying service
            instances. A service instance registers its network location using a POST request. Every 30 seconds it must refresh
            its registration using a PUT request. A registration is removed by either using an HTTP DELETE request or by
            the instance registration timing out. As you might expect, a client can retrieve the registered service instances
            by using an HTTP GET request.</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">etcd</a> – A highly available, distributed, consistent,
            key-value store that is used for shared configuration and service discovery. Two notable projects that use etcd
            are Kubernetes and <a target="_blank" href="http://pivotal.io/platform">Cloud&nbsp;Foundry</a>.</li>

        <li><a target="_blank" href="http://zookeeper.apache.org/">Apache&nbsp;Zookeeper</a> – A widely used, high-performance
            coordination service for distributed applications. Apache Zookeeper was originally a subproject of Hadoop but
            is now a top-level project.</li>
        <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.consul.io/">consul</a> – A tool for discovering and configuring services. It
            provides an API that allows clients to register and discover services. Consul can perform health checks to determine
            service availability.</li>
