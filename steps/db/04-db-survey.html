<h2>DBA survey</h2>
<p>Question: how DBA answer to changes in the third step:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sure it looks ok</li>
    <li>Sure here are a small fix - this way it will work better</li>
    <li>You are stupid, get out (in polite words)</li>
    <li>The third step is commented out on production</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes">
    The last one is the correct one. Almost every big release we send a "correct" procedure. 
    But they comment out the third step, changes 2 others. What the hell is wrong here?
    For more than few YEARS we deploy our SQL script, they changed it and apply it on production.
    <br/>
    <b>WTF you will say?</b>
    <br/>But one week later I told this story to my friend. He sums up it with: It is normal with DBAs.
    Whats going on?
