    The tools that belong to the same class retain the same principles and ideas. 
    If you are familiar with one of such tool, you will find it pretty easy to learn how to work with another one. 
    Nevertheless, the functionality behind them might differ a lot, 
    so it’s important to carefully choose one that fulfills your project’s needs the most.

    A small funny history from my life. In mBank one of the databases is an audit one. It is backuped every day.
    I want to change backup procedure to make another copy. 
    It is completly not important why here so I will ommit this part.
    <br/>----<br/>
    The orginal procedure wast commited as simple SQL file in the repository with all DB structure. 
    If something had changed in the structure we send all SQL files. 
    We can just drop and create a new DB because it was audit stuff, backuped somewhere.

    I decided to change step number 3 out of 5. But to be sure I send the question to DBA with changes. 
    Now I would like You to do a small survey:
