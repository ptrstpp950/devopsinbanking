    <blockquote>
        <p>DevOps was originally about WebOps at Internet companies working in the Cloud and a handful of Lean Startups in Silicon
            Valley. It started at these companies because they had to move quickly, so they found new, simple, and collaborative
            ways of working that allowed them to innovate much faster and to scale much more effectively than organizations
            had done before. </p>

    <p>Why not?
        <ul>
            <li>Because it is complicated</li>
            <li>Because of law regulations</li>
            <li>When Facebook is down, people tweet about it, but when the bank is down people take money somewhere else.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Let me tell you a history about "what can happen when the bank is down". Imagine that you invite parents of your bride-to-be
        to the official dinner in the very expensive restaurant. To show off, how good you are. After the dinner, you would
        like to pay, but your bank is down. How do you feel?. This history is true and was published on social media. It
        happen not from our fault, but it happened. We lost our client. Such situation would happen on facebook or eBay because
        banking is much more serious stuff</p>
    <p>
        Now you will say no way. Facebook is different. On January a lot of services published information about
        <br/><b>"Facebook made its Android app crash to test your loyalty".</b>
        <br/>The conclusion was amaizing: "People never stopped coming back"
    </p>
    <p>But what am I doing here if the answer is nooooooo? next slide</p>
